# MorphoOrganismos

Mathematical models of morphogenesis and pattern formation based on analysis of eigenfunctions.

## Python
Using FEniCS finite element package to compute eigenfunctions on domains and solve RD equations. To use this code:
1. Install Anaconda python distribution
2. Create an environment as follows: conda create -n fenicsenv matplotlib fenics mshr jupyter
3. Activate the environment: source activate fenicsenv
4. Run the notebook: jupyter notebook <name>

## Matlab
This is old code used to test some ideas. Based on a coarse regular grid. Not really documented.
