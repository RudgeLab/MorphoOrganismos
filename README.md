# MorphoOrganismos

Mathematical models of morphogenesis and pattern formation based on analysis of eigenfunctions.

## Python
Using FEniCS finite element package to compute eigenfunctions on domains and solve RD equations.

## Matlab
This is old code used to testing some ideas. Based on course regular grid. Not really documented.
